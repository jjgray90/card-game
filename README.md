# card-game

A simple snap game programme built in java. 

Running the game prompts you to enter player names, there must be at least one player for the game to commence. Players press enter for their turn, and the game continues in this fashion until the current card value and the previous card value match. The player has 3 seconds to type "SNAP" to win the game. If they mispell, or take longer than the alloted time, the game continues.
